**Dataset Information:**

  * The Dream Housing Finance organization handles all types of mortgages. They are present in all areas—rural, semi-urban, and metropolitan. The consumer applies for a house loan first, and the firm verifies that the customer is eligible for the loan. The goal of the company is to automate the loan qualifying process in real time, using the client information submitted on the online application form. These include information on the borrower's gender, credit history, number of dependents, marriage, education, and income. In order to target these clients directly, they have created a challenge to identify the customer groups that qualify for a certain loan amount in order to automate this procedure.
